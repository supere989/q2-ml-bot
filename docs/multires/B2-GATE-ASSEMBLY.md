# B2 gate assembly

`tools/assemble_b2_gate.py` is the only writer for a green
`q2-multires-b2-gate-v1` document. It has no discovery, count-only,
replacement, salvage, partial, overwrite, or red-report mode. A failed input
prints one refusal to stderr and writes no gate.

The assembler requires the repository to be clean before it reads the current
commit, tree, generator, route generator, and complete Atlas analyzer closure.
The 71433 source freeze, generated Atlas build report, test report, every
analysis manifest, and the real Dyn proof must carry that same implementation
authority. An intervening commit makes all earlier implementation-bound
evidence stale.

## Required producer reports

- `tools/run_generator_cohort.py generate` writes the exact 71433 source
  freeze. The primary and cold source directories remain immutable inputs.
- `tools/run_generator_cohort.py verify-stage` writes canonical compiled and
  materialized membership reports. `tools/run_compiled_static_campaign.py`
  writes canonical `q2-generator-v6-compiled-static-campaign-v1` evidence with
  all 28 independently recomputed `static_validate` rows.
- `tools/run_generator_claim_campaign.py prepare` writes the exact claims
  stage and prepare report.
- `tools/run_generated_atlas_campaign.py` atomically writes the exact 224-file
  analysis root and `q2-generated-atlas-build-campaign-v1` report.
- `tools/run_generator_claim_campaign.py validate` writes the 28-map compiled
  validation report.
- Each stock map has one canonical
  `<map>.stock-validation.json` from
  `tools/generator_claim_validator.py --mode stock`. The stock BSP, analysis,
  and validation roots contain exactly the eight pinned maps and no other
  file or symlink. Independent cold evidence is embedded in and revalidated
  from each analysis manifest.
- `tools/q2-dyn-evidence` runs on `DESKTOP-RTX2080` WSL and atomically writes
  its report plus four real `Q2LAT002` snapshots. Its selected map must be a
  member of the admitted 71433 population. The assembler binds it to the exact
  local Atlas manifest, raw Atlas, BSP, analyzer authority, crate commit, WSL
  identity, snapshot bytes, negative fences, and p99 measurement. Build the
  producer once from the clean committed root, retain that exact executable,
  and copy those same executable bytes to WSL. The gate independently decodes
  every header and zstd payload, validates the payload digest/cells/derived L3,
  and requires a byte-identical semantic and canonical-zstd re-encode. A magic
  prefix alone is never evidence.
- `tools/run_b2_test_suite.py --output NEW_DIRECTORY` executes the fixed Python,
  Rust, and standalone Dyn-helper suites and atomically writes
  `b2-test-report.json` plus seven hashed raw logs. The directory must be
  outside the repository so its creation does not invalidate the clean Git
  binding.

## Assembly template

All values are exact paths. `OUT` must not exist and must be outside the
implementation repository so publishing the gate cannot invalidate its own
clean-tree authority.

The assembler independently reruns exact membership, all 28 generated claim
validations, and all eight stock validations. It derives representative Atlas
limits from the admitted analysis manifest selected by the Dyn report, rather
than accepting a second budget assertion. The output is canonical compact,
sorted JSON with one trailing newline and is created with exclusive-create
semantics only after every B2 predicate is green.
